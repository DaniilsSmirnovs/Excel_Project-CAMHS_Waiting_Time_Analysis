# CAMHS Waiting Time Analysis

## Introduction

Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) provide assessment and treatment for children and young people under 18 who are struggling with their mental health. Early service delivery is key to producing positive outcomes, as it increases the likelihood of recovery and reduces the impact of mental health problems on the education and social development. In this project, I set out to analyse waiting times for CAMHS across 14 NHS Health Boards in Scotland.

## NHS Health Boards

## Questions to Analyze

To understand how CAMHS perform in Scotland, I asked the following:

- Do Health Boards meet their 18-week target for CAMHS?
- What are the trends in Health Boards performance over time?
- Do more referrals mean longer waiting time?
- How many children and adolescents are waiting longer than recommended in the most recent month available?

## Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- 📊 Pivot Tables
- 📈 Pivot Charts
